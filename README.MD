# EZQueue

EZQueue is an [app](http://bit.ly/EZQueue) that allows people to enter queue remotely. Currently it's build for restaurants. The tool is for both customers and business owners. Using queueing models built on data for your restaurant, EZQueue provides accurate queue-waiting-time for customers and valuable business analytics for business owners.

## Getting Started
